Answer: The MAPK1 E322K mutation is a rare mutation that has been identified in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The MAPK1 E322K mutation is a gain-of-function mutation that leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The MAPK pathway is a signaling pathway that regulates cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The MAPK1 E322K mutation has been shown to promote tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy in preclinical models.

Question: What are treatment options for 
                salivary duct carcinoma patients with PIK3CA E545K mutation?
Answer: The PIK3CA E545K mutation is a rare mutation that has been reported in salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). The PIK3CA E545K mutation is a gain-of-function mutation that activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a key pathway in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The PIK3CA E545K mutation has been shown to be associated with resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer. In addition, the PIK3CA E545K mutation has been shown to be associated with resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer. Therefore, the PIK3CA E545K mutation may be associated with resistance to endocrine therapy and trastuzumab in SDC.
