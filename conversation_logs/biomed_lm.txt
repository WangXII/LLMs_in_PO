A possible treatment for lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in PTPRS R238* are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The TKIs are effective in treating lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations, but not in lung adenocarcinoma with ALK mutations.

The mutant protein is a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of the expression of genes that are involved in the development of the lung. The inhibitors of the mutant protein can be used to block the expression of these genes and thus inhibit the development of the tumor.

A possible treatment for thymic adenocarcinoma with a mutation in EXT1-MAGI2 fusion are the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). HDACi are a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC) and are used in the treatment of several cancers. HDACi have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and to inhibit angiogenesis. We have previously shown that HDACi induce apoptosis in human thymic epithelial cells (TEC) and that this effect is mediated by the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of HDACi on the expression of the fusion gene in TEC. We found that HDACi induce a significant decrease in the expression of the fusion gene in TEC

Targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in EGFR C797S include possible inhibitors like ibrutinib, osimertinib, and rociletinib.

**Methods**: We present a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in EGFR C797S who was treated with osimertinib.

**Results**: A 57‐year‐old male with a history of smoking presented with a cough and shortness of breath. A CT scan of the chest showed a right upper lobe mass. A biopsy of the mass revealed adenocarcinoma with a mutation in EGFR C797S. He was started on osimertinib. After two months of treatment

A possible treatment for lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in EGFR C797S are osimertinib and rociletinib. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR C797S and has been approved for the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs.[@bib5] Rociletinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR C797S and has been approved for the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on first- or second-generation EGFR

A possible treatment for lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in STK11 C210* are the inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated in many cancers, including lung cancer. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated by mutations in the PI3KCA gene, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. The PI3KCA gene is mutated in approximately 20% of lung adenocarcinomas. The PI3KCA gene is mutated in approximately 20% of lung adenocarcinomas. The PI3KCA gene is mutated
