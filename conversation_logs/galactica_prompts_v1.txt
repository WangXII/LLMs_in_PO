Question: What are treatment options for lung adenocarcinoma patients with a mutation in KRAS G13D?

Answer: There are currently no approved targeted therapies for KRAS G13D mutant lung adenocarcinoma. However, there are several promising agents in development.

Preclinical studies have shown that KRAS G13D mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells are sensitive to SHP2 inhibition. In a phase I clinical trial, the SHP2 inhibitor RMC-4630 was well tolerated and showed evidence of antitumor activity in patients with KRAS G13D mutant lung adenocarcinoma.
